# Squad Pulse — Status

One-page entry point for picking this project up cold. Update the session log at the bottom
whenever you finish a chunk of work — this is the one place "what's outstanding" lives; the other
docs in `docs/` are reference material this file points to, not duplicates of it.

## What's real right now

- `public/` is a working static site — `index.html` + `styles.css` + `vendor/qrcode.js` +
  `local-store.js` + `app.js` + twelve feature modules under `public/js/` (see "The app's file
  layout" below). Originally ported verbatim from the Claude Artifact prototype
  (`squad-pulse.html`) as one 2396-line `app.js`, then split by feature on 2026-09-11 (and
  `retro.js` split again, into its facilitator/participant halves, on 2026-09-12) with zero
  intended behavior change either time. No build step; open `public/index.html` directly or serve `public/`
  with any static file server.
- Full feature set works standalone in one browser tab: squad ratings across a customizable
  dimension template, Tribe-view cross-squad rollup, and the facilitated live-retro flow (join by
  code/QR, blind statement survey or direct green/yellow/red pick depending on the dimension,
  live or held reveal, facilitator override, finish-and-apply into the squad's real ratings).
- Two-tier regression coverage under `tests/`, all passing as of the last run (2026-09-12) — see
  `tests/README.md`. **`tests/unit/`**: 2 plain-Node files (`node:test`, nothing to install) for
  pure logic with no DOM dependency — consolidation/scoring math, CSV parsing/column-matching —
  running in ~0.1s total (see `tests/unit/README.md`). **`tests/test_*.py`**: 21 Playwright files
  (named for the feature/flow each one covers) for everything that needs a real browser, running in
  under 2 minutes total after a 2026-09-12 speedup (see the session log below) — zero JS errors on
  the last run. Most drive the app through a fake in-memory store (`tests/fixtures/fake_store.html`
  + `tests/fixtures/build_page.py`) standing in for the real backend, for speed and determinism; a
  handful deliberately bypass it because they exist specifically to test what it stands in for —
  `test_local_store.py` (the real `localStorage` board), `test_relay_cross_device_sync.py` (the real
  relay, WebSocket, and encryption, together), and `test_relay_error_handling.py` (the relay's
  failure modes). Both tiers run automatically on every push/PR via `.github/workflows/tests.yml`.
- `vercel.json` is in place for zero-config static hosting (`outputDirectory: "public"`), and the
  repo **is now connected to Vercel** — feature branches deploy to preview URLs (confirmed
  2026-09-12 via real testing on one). The relay is not part of that deployment and isn't deployed
  anywhere yet (see the relay bullet below and `relay/README.md`) — a preview/production Vercel
  deployment with no relay configured is expected to run the board fully, with live retro sessions
  correctly reporting themselves unavailable rather than hanging (see "Deliberately not built yet").
- **Retro sessions now sync across real devices.** `relay/` is a small standalone Node/`ws`
  WebSocket server; `public/js/relay-client.js` + `public/js/crypto.js` route every
  `sessions`-rooted `db` call to it (encrypted, per the decision below) instead of `localStorage`,
  while squads/dimensions/templates/config stay local as before. Verified end to end — real relay
  process, two independent browser contexts, real WebSocket, real AES-GCM — by
  `tests/test_relay_cross_device_sync.py`. Not yet deployed anywhere public; see `relay/README.md`.

## The app's file layout

`public/app.js` used to be one 2396-line file (a single IIFE, ported verbatim from the Claude
Artifact prototype). It's now a thin entry point — view-switch wiring, the one cross-cutting
Escape-key handler, and `start()`/boot — and the actual feature code lives in `public/js/`, split
along the seams the original file already had (`// ---------- section ----------` comments):

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `state.js` | Shared `state` object, starter templates, placeholder squads/dimensions, initial UI-prefs load. Loads first. |
| `helpers.js` | Pure helpers used everywhere: `esc`, `diag`, banding/consolidation math, `colorWord`/`trendWord`, `isStatementDimension`, `sortedSquads`/`sortedDimensions`, `findSquad`, unit-label helpers, and the `liveOr`/`syncLiveIfConnected` write-shape helpers every mutator uses. |
| `render.js` | `renderAll` and everything it drives — header/stats/ranking/hotspots/grid/legend, grid tooltip. |
| `modals.js` | The generic confirm modal, the cell-rating modal, and the busy overlay — shared widgets several features reuse. |
| `squads.js` | Squad CRUD, Admin's squad list, Squad view, and the `persistDimensionRating(s)` writer. |
| `retro-facilitator.js` | The FACILITATOR half of retro sessions: start/close, the session card, reveal-mode/override + sprint note, finish-and-apply, the live response tally, QR rendering. Split out from a single `retro.js` on 2026-09-12 — see the session log below. |
| `retro-join.js` | The PARTICIPANT half: the join screen, the blind interleaved statement survey, direct-rating swatches, submission, and the personal-result view. Shares almost no code with `retro-facilitator.js` (different device, different role) — that's what made the split clean. |
| `dimensions.js` | The dimension manager (add/rename/reorder/remove). Split out of a combined `dimensions-templates.js` on 2026-09-12. |
| `templates.js` | Template save/load/delete. Split out of the same combined file, same day. |
| `csv.js` | CSV export and import (parsing, column matching, preview, apply). |
| `db.js` | `initDb()` — the Firestore-shaped snapshot listeners that wire `db` writes into `state` and back into a render. |
| `crypto.js` | AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt for retro-session documents, key derived from the session code. |
| `relay-client.js` | The other half of `local-store.js`'s router: a `collection()`/`doc()` implementation for `sessions`-rooted paths, backed by a real WebSocket to `relay/server.js` instead of `localStorage`. |

**These are plain classic `<script>` files sharing the global scope, not ES modules** — Chromium
blocks cross-file `import` over `file://` with a CORS error, which would break both the Playwright
suite (every test navigates via `file://`) and the README's "open `index.html` directly" workflow.
`index.html` loads them in the order above, then `app.js` last; load order only matters for the
handful of top-level `document.getElementById(...)` lookups each file does for elements that are
already in the DOM by the time these scripts run (they sit at the end of `<body>`) — every actual
cross-file *call* happens inside a function body triggered later (an event handler, or `start()`),
by which point every file has finished loading, so the specific order between the twelve files
doesn't otherwise matter.

## The one thing to know before touching the app

`public/js/db.js`'s `initDb()` persists everything through a single call:

```js
window.claude.use("db")
```

That's a Claude-Artifact-only API — it doesn't exist outside a Claude Artifact sandbox.
`public/local-store.js` (loaded before every `js/*.js` file) now provides a same-shaped replacement
for plain deployments, and it's a small **router**, not one flat store: for any path rooted at
`"sessions"`, it delegates to `SquadPulseRelay` (`public/js/relay-client.js`), which speaks the
same `collection()`/`doc()` shape but syncs over a real WebSocket to `relay/server.js`, encrypting
every document with `public/js/crypto.js` before it leaves the browser. Everything else (squads,
dimensions, templates, `meta/config`) still goes to this browser's own `localStorage`, unchanged.
`window.claude.use("downloads")` still triggers a real browser file download. The whole shim only
installs itself when no real `window.claude` is already present, so it's a no-op both inside a
Claude Artifact and inside the Playwright test harness (`tests/fixtures/fake_store.html` sets its
own `window.claude` and loads after this file — see `build_page.py`). **Retro sessions now
genuinely sync across different devices/browsers** through the relay — see the new bullet above and
`relay/README.md`. Squads/dimensions/templates/config still don't sync across devices, per the
locked decision below; only a session's own content does.
(There's one other `window.claude.use(...)` call, for `"downloads"` in `public/js/csv.js`, and a
`window.claude.hot` hot-reload guard at the bottom of `app.js` that already degrades safely with no
`window.claude` present — neither of those blocks anything.)

## Decisions locked in (don't re-litigate these)

- **No persistent, multi-tenant database, ever.** A facilitator's own browser is the board's
  source of truth — squads, templates, ratings. Durability beyond one browser session is an
  explicit **Save board → file** / **Load board ← file** action, not always-on persistence. (Not
  implemented yet — see below.)
- **Only a live retro session touches a server**, and only for that session's lifetime — an
  ephemeral, in-memory, per-session-code relay (dimensions snapshot + responses + status/
  revealMode/overrides/experimentNote), forgotten once the room empties. No database.
- **Self-hosted relay + client-side encryption**, chosen deliberately over Firebase/Supabase.
  Built 2026-09-11 — see `relay/` and `public/js/crypto.js`/`relay-client.js`. One deviation from
  the original sketch, made deliberately: the encryption key is **derived from the session code
  itself** (`SHA-256(code)`), not an independent random secret in a URL fragment. The reason is the
  app's *primary* join path is typing the 6-character code by hand (the fix for a real iPhone
  QR-handoff bug already in this codebase) — a path with no fragment to carry a separate key.
  Deriving the key from the code keeps both join paths working. Be honest about what this does and
  doesn't buy: real protection against passive network eavesdropping and against answers sitting in
  plaintext in relay logs/memory/backups — but NOT protection against a relay operator who
  deliberately computes the same public hash, since the code and the room id are the same value.
  Full rationale and the researched Excalidraw/Vercel architecture this is based on:
  `docs/standalone-plan.md`.
- **The relay is a plain standalone Node process, deployed as a genuinely separate small service —
  deliberately NOT a Vercel Function**, even though Vercel Functions gained native WebSocket support
  in 2026. Verified against Vercel's own docs before deciding: a new connection there isn't
  guaranteed to land on the same Function instance as an existing one, so Vercel's own guidance for
  shared cross-connection state (rooms, presence, pub/sub — this relay's whole job) is to add Redis.
  Rejected because this project has two audiences that both lose from that: embedding on a company
  website, and forking the repo to self-host entirely offline on a LAN to route around a company's
  own security constraints — the latter shouldn't need to provision a database just to run one
  WebSocket relay. `render.yaml` at the repo root makes deploying the unmodified Node process to
  Render close to one-click; the exact same process also runs via `npm start` on a LAN with no cloud
  account at all. Full writeup and the doc-verified reasoning: `relay/README.md`'s "Why not a Vercel
  Function" and `docs/standalone-plan.md`'s "Where this runs".
- **Retro-session feature behavior** (consolidation rule, anonymity model, per-template scoring)
  is specified and versioned in `docs/facilitated-retro-spec.md` — that file has its own session
  log for that feature's history; don't duplicate it here.
- **"This retro has ended" vs. "this retro isn't open" is a real distinction, but only within the
  relay's own room lifetime — not indefinitely.** `closeSession()` writes `status:"closed"` instead
  of deleting the doc, so the join screen can say "ended" for as long as that doc still exists (the
  relay's own room-empty grace period, or longer if someone's still connected). Once the relay has
  genuinely forgotten a room (garbage-collected, or the process restarted), a closed-long-ago code
  and a code that never existed are the same thing again — there is no way to keep that distinction
  forever without adding real persistence, which is exactly the trade-off already rejected for the
  relay itself (see the Vercel Function decision above). This is the deliberate stopping point.

## Deliberately not built yet (and why)

| Not built | Why it's cut for now | What would trigger building it |
|---|---|---|
| Relay deployed anywhere public | Built, tested, and now deploy-ready (`render.yaml` + `SQUAD_PULSE_RELAY_URL`-driven build step — see `relay/README.md`), but this session has no hosting/Vercel account access to actually click "deploy" | Whoever has account access runs the Render blueprint (or any equivalent host) and sets the Vercel env var — see `relay/README.md`'s "Wiring the deployed static site to this relay" for the exact steps, including testing it on a Preview deployment before merging to `main` |
| Co-facilitator "finish retro" ownership | A session doc is self-contained, so a co-facilitator's device can watch/reveal/override live over the relay with no extra work — but "Finish & apply" writes into the SQUAD's own rating, which lives in whichever browser's local board actually holds that squad. A co-facilitator on a genuinely different, independently-seeded browser doesn't have that squad locally, so their "Finish" would write nowhere useful. Open question, not yet resolved: should only the session's originating device be allowed to finish, or does finishing need to become a relay-carried action the owning board listens for? | Whenever a real second facilitator device needs to finish a retro, not just watch one |
| Save-board / Load-board-to-file | `local-store.js` already persists the board via `localStorage`, which covers the same browser/device | Once someone needs a board to move between browsers/devices without a relay |
| Relay deployed on Vercel itself (one deployment, not two) | Deliberately rejected, not just deferred — see the locked decision above and `relay/README.md`'s "Why not a Vercel Function" | Only if Vercel's WebSocket support later guarantees same-instance routing without an external store, which would remove the reason this was rejected |
| Embedding decision (subdomain+iframe vs. same-site route) | Blocked on the Dr. Agile marketing site's stack, which wasn't settled as of this writing | Once the marketing site (separate Claude Code project) is further along |

## Suggested next step

Two independent tracks, either can go first:

1. **Deploy the relay.** No code changes needed — the static site is already live on Vercel; the
   relay just needs someone with a Render (or equivalent) account to run the `render.yaml`
   blueprint at the repo root, then set `SQUAD_PULSE_RELAY_URL` in Vercel's project settings (scope
   it to Preview first to test on this branch before merging to `main`, then Production). Full
   steps: `relay/README.md`'s "Deploying it" and "Wiring the deployed static site to this relay".
   This is the real unblock for testing cross-device retro sessions with a real team, not just in
   this repo's own tests.
2. **Resolve the co-facilitator "finish retro" question** above, then build whatever it takes
   (likely a relay-carried "finish" action the session's owning device listens for and applies
   locally, rather than a raw squads-collection write from any device).

## Session log

- 2026-09-10 — Migrated the project from a single-file Claude Artifact (3077-line inline-script
  `squad-pulse.html`) into this repo as a clean static-site layout (`public/index.html` + `app.js`
  + `styles.css` + `vendor/qrcode.js`), with zero behavioral change. Ported and de-duplicated the
  full 13-file Playwright regression suite onto the new structure, introducing a shared
  `tests/fixtures/build_page.py` fixture (fixed a latent hidden dependency where tests v3–v13
  silently relied on `test_v2.py` having already generated a file on disk). All tests verified
  passing with zero JS errors. Pushed as commit `934f69b` on top of the repo's auto-generated
  initial commit.
- 2026-09-10 — Fixed a real bug in the retro-session feature (teammates couldn't answer the
  board's default Spotify Squad Health Check template in Retro mode — only the facilitator
  could). Full detail and fix description live in `docs/facilitated-retro-spec.md`, not
  duplicated here since it's feature-specific.
- 2026-09-11 — Added `public/local-store.js`: a localStorage-backed shim for the Firestore-shaped
  `db` capability and the `downloads` capability, so the app works outside a Claude Artifact
  sandbox (e.g. deployed on Vercel) instead of sitting in local-only preview mode with nothing
  persisted. Seeds a starter board (3 squads, the 12 Spotify Squad Health Check dimensions) on
  first run. Installs only when no real `window.claude` is present, so Claude Artifact previews
  and the Playwright test harness are unaffected — full regression suite verified passing with
  zero JS errors. Cross-device retro sync still needs the relay described above; this only covers
  the board itself plus same-browser multi-tab sync.
- 2026-09-11 — Hardened the regression suite ahead of refactoring `app.js`: renamed the 13
  `test_v2.py`..`test_v13.py`/`test_generic.py` files to names that describe what they cover (see
  `tests/README.md`'s naming table), added `test_tribe_hotspots.py` and `test_local_store.py` to
  close two real coverage gaps (Tribe view's cross-squad rollup, and `local-store.js` itself — both
  had zero tests), removed a sandbox-specific hardcoded browser path from all 15 files so the suite
  actually runs in CI, and added `.github/workflows/tests.yml` to run it on every push/PR.
- 2026-09-11 — Split `app.js` (2396 lines, one IIFE) into `app.js` (thin entry point) + nine feature
  modules under `public/js/` — see "The app's file layout" above for the map and for why they're
  plain classic scripts, not ES modules (Chromium blocks `import` over `file://`, which the test
  suite and the "open index.html directly" workflow both rely on). Zero intended behavior change;
  verified by the full 15-file regression suite passing with zero JS errors both before and after.
- 2026-09-11 — Built the relay: `relay/server.js` (Node + `ws`, tiny in-memory per-code room store,
  2-minute empty-room grace period), `public/js/crypto.js` (AES-256-GCM via Web Crypto, key derived
  from the session code — see the locked decision above for why and its honest limits), and
  `public/js/relay-client.js` (same `collection()`/`doc()` shape as `local-store.js`, so `db.js`
  needed zero changes). `local-store.js` now routes any `sessions`-rooted path to the relay client
  instead of `localStorage`. Two real bugs found and fixed along the way, both by actually testing
  against a live relay rather than trusting the design: (1) Chromium's ES-module CORS block over
  `file://` doesn't apply to WebSocket connections or `crypto.subtle` — verified both directly
  before relying on either; (2) the broad `db.collection("sessions").onSnapshot(...)` listener
  (used to notice a facilitator's own already-open session after reload) captured the "known
  codes" list once at subscribe time and never revisited it, so a session started *after* boot
  never appeared — fixed with a small pub/sub (`broadListeners` in relay-client.js) that any newly
  ‑discovered room notifies. Verified end to end by `tests/test_relay_cross_device_sync.py`: a real
  relay subprocess, two independent Playwright browser contexts (facilitator + participant) with
  their own localStorage, and a third late-joiner confirming a closed session is really gone —
  zero JS errors. Full existing 16-file suite re-verified passing with zero regressions. Not yet
  deployed anywhere public (see `relay/README.md` for how). Left open: co-facilitator "finish
  retro" ownership (see the not-built table above) — explicitly out of scope for this step.
- 2026-09-12 — Fixed five real bugs found by testing the deployed Vercel preview, none of them
  visible from local `file://` testing alone. Root cause of the big one: `index.html` defaulted
  `SQUAD_PULSE_RELAY_URL` to `ws://localhost:8787` unconditionally, so on a real deployment the
  page tried to reach a WebSocket on the *visitor's own machine* — Chrome's Private Network Access
  policy pops a permission prompt for that (an https:// page opening a loopback socket), nothing
  was ever listening there, and the old unbounded-retry loop then reconnected every 5s forever.
  Clicking "Start retro session" repeatedly (since nothing appeared to happen) spawned one orphaned
  room per click, which is why the diagnostic log showed nine different codes all reconnecting at
  once. Fixes: (1) `index.html` now only defaults to a local relay when the page itself is local
  (`file://`/`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`) — a real deployment with no override gets `null`; (2)
  `relay-client.js` fails fast with zero WebSocket attempts when no relay is configured, and gives
  up after 8 reconnect attempts (bounded backoff) instead of retrying forever when one is
  configured but unreachable, surfacing a real error via a new `unavailable` rejection on writes;
  (3) `retro.js`'s "Start retro session" button is now guarded by a module-level flag (not just its
  own `disabled` attribute, which a re-render can hand back fresh mid-request) so rapid/duplicate
  clicks can't spawn more than one session, and a failed start now opens a real error dialog
  instead of silently doing nothing; (4) `helpers.js`'s `diag()` no longer overwrites the log's
  `textContent` while the user has an in-progress selection inside it, so the diagnostic log can
  actually be selected and copied; (5) added the board's own default dimension set as a proper,
  reloadable starter template (`state.js`'s `SPOTIFY_TEMPLATE`, "Spotify Squad Health Check") —
  previously it only existed as seed data for a fresh board with no way to load it back after
  switching to Five Dysfunctions or Tuckman. All five verified directly (not just by inspection):
  the relay-URL defaulting logic as a pure function across all four input cases, the fail-fast and
  bounded-retry behavior via an isolated harness loading only `crypto.js`+`relay-client.js`
  (`test_relay_error_handling.py`), the click-guard via 5 rapid clicks producing exactly one
  session doc, the selection-preservation via a real `Selection`/`Range`, and the Spotify template
  via load/switch/reload round-tripping all 12 dimensions (`test_starter_template_spotify.py`).
  Full 18-file suite (16 previous + these 2 new files) re-verified passing with zero JS errors and
  zero regressions. Still true, and now more clearly *surfaced* rather than silently broken: the
  relay isn't deployed anywhere public yet, so live retro sessions on the Vercel preview correctly
  report themselves unavailable (clear error dialog, no hang, no runaway reconnect spam) rather
  than working end to end — deploying the relay (see "Suggested next step") is what actually
  unblocks cross-device retro testing.
- 2026-09-12 — Made the relay actually deployable, for two audiences stated explicitly this round:
  embedding this on a company website (subdomain/iframe) and forking the repo so others can
  self-host it entirely offline on their own LAN, to route around their own security constraints.
  Considered deploying the relay as a Vercel Function using their newly-public-beta native
  WebSocket support, so the whole app ships from one Vercel project — checked this directly against
  Vercel's own current docs rather than assuming the earlier sketch in `docs/standalone-plan.md`
  still held, and rejected it: a new connection there isn't guaranteed to land on the same Function
  instance as an existing one, and Vercel's fix for that (external Redis) is a real ongoing
  dependency neither audience wants — see the new locked decision above and `relay/README.md`'s "Why
  not a Vercel Function" for the full reasoning. Instead: (1) added `render.yaml` at the repo root
  so deploying the unmodified `relay/server.js` to Render is close to one-click (reads `PORT` from
  the environment already, so nothing else to configure); (2) added
  `scripts/generate-relay-config.js` as `vercel.json`'s new `buildCommand`, which writes
  `public/relay-config.js` from a `SQUAD_PULSE_RELAY_URL` environment variable set in Vercel's
  project settings — scopeable to Preview (to test a real relay on this branch before merging) or
  Production independently, with the build step a safe no-op (checked-in placeholder stays) when
  the variable isn't set, so a bare fork with zero config still deploys and degrades exactly as the
  previous round's fixes intended. `relay/README.md` now also spells out the plain `npm start` +
  hand-set `ws://<LAN-IP>:8787` path for the LAN self-host case, which needed no code changes at
  all — the relay was already a dependency-free Node process. Verified end to end by the new
  `tests/test_relay_config_injection.py`: the generator script's output for both the set and unset
  cases, and — driven through `index.html`'s real script order — that an injected value actually
  wins over the page's own protocol/hostname default rather than just asserting it should. Full
  19-file suite re-verified passing with zero JS errors and zero regressions. Still true: nobody has
  actually clicked "deploy" on the relay yet, since that needs a Render (or equivalent) account this
  session doesn't have — the Render blueprint and the Vercel env var are the two concrete steps left
  for whoever does.
- 2026-09-12 — Three rounds of fixes chasing a real "session isn't open" report from an iPhone
  joining a live Vercel preview, each one uncovering the next:
  1. The join screen (`#viewJoin`) has no nav back to Admin's own Diagnostics panel by design (a
     participant shouldn't see the facilitator's board), which meant it also had no way to show
     ANY diagnostic info — a stuck participant had nothing to screenshot. `diag()` now updates every
     element with `class="diag-log"` instead of only Admin's `#diagLog` by id; the join screen gets
     its own collapsed-by-default "Trouble joining? Tap for diagnostics" panel.
  2. That surfaced a second, worse gap on the facilitator's own device: clicking "Start retro
     session" left the button disabled forever with NOTHING new in Diagnostics — every explicit
     `diag()` call in the app lives inside a `.then()`/`.catch()`, so a synchronous throw upstream of
     those vanished without a trace. `helpers.js` now forwards `window`'s own `error` and
     `unhandledrejection` events into `diag()` unconditionally, so the log always shows *something*.
  3. That, in turn, revealed the actual bug on the next attempt: `new WebSocket(...)` throws a
     SyntaxError SYNCHRONOUSLY for a malformed scheme, and the real-world cause was a one-letter
     typo in the `SQUAD_PULSE_RELAY_URL` Vercel env var (`was://` instead of `wss://`). `getRoom()`
     in `relay-client.js` now validates the scheme up front and fails the same clean,
     catchable way "no relay configured" already did, instead of an uncaught exception.
  Separately, answered a real design question this raised — can "this retro isn't open" (bad/never-
  existed code) be told apart from "this retro has ended" (closed) without a database? Partially,
  honestly: `closeSession()` now writes `status:"closed"` (an `update`) instead of deleting the doc
  outright, so a participant already on the join screen, or one who opens a stale link soon after,
  sees a real "This retro has ended" — for as long as the relay's own room-empty grace period keeps
  that doc around, since nothing here is a real database and a code the relay has fully forgotten is
  genuinely indistinguishable from one that never existed. Also added a third, distinct message —
  "Can't connect to the retro server" — for when this device never reached the relay at all, as
  opposed to reaching it and finding no such room; `relay-client.js` now carries an `unavailable`
  flag on every doc snapshot so `retro.js` can tell the two apart. Closing a session also now
  explicitly forgets its code from this device's local "known codes" bookkeeping the moment it's
  marked closed (previously only a hard delete did this), so a status-only update can't leave this
  device silently reconnecting to every session it's ever started, forever.
  A fourth round, from a follow-up report with the same symptom ("stuck in Starting...") but a diag
  log this time showing the write had actually succeeded (`Started retro session ... Sessions
  snapshot #4: 1 doc(s)`), found the real remaining bug: every db snapshot listener gates its own
  re-render on `state.ui.view==="..."` (see `db.js`) — a snapshot that arrives while a view is
  hidden updates `state` correctly but never touches that view's DOM, since nothing was watching.
  `setView()` (`app.js`) only ever toggled `hidden` attributes, so switching back to a view just
  un-hid whatever HTML was already there from before — stale. This is exactly what happened: click
  "Start retro", switch to Admin to check Diagnostics while the relay connects (a real few-second
  wait watching a cold relay wake up), the session starts successfully while Admin is showing, then
  switching back to Squad shows the disabled button from before, forever, since nothing re-rendered
  it. Fixed by having `setView()` call `renderAll()` on every switch — cheap (in-memory state to
  DOM, no network), the same function already used elsewhere for "state changed broadly, refresh
  everything." Verified with a dedicated test that reproduces the exact sequence (start a session,
  switch away before its snapshot lands, seed the doc while hidden, switch back, confirm the real
  session card shows) — `test_view_switch_refreshes_stale_state.py`.
  Verified end to end, not just by inspection: a synthetic sync throw and a synthetic unhandled
  rejection both confirmed reaching `#diagLog`
  (`test_uncaught_error_diagnostics.py`); the join screen's own diagnostics panel confirmed reachable
  and populated for a real "not found" case (`test_retro_join_flow.py`); the malformed-scheme case
  confirmed to fail with zero WebSocket attempts and zero uncaught exceptions, and the real join
  screen confirmed to show "Can't connect" (not "isn't open") for an unreachable-but-valid URL
  (`test_relay_error_handling.py`); and, over the real relay, a just-closed session confirmed to read
  as "ended" while a never-existed code still reads as the generic message
  (`test_relay_cross_device_sync.py`). Full 20-file suite re-verified passing with zero regressions.
- 2026-09-12 — Confirmed working end to end on a real deployed preview: a facilitator on Chrome ran
  a full retro with a participant on an iPhone and another on Safari, over the deployed relay.
  Separately, assessed whether Playwright was the right tool for the whole suite — it wasn't, for
  part of it: pure logic with zero DOM dependency (consolidation/scoring math in `helpers.js`, CSV
  parsing/column-matching in `csv.js`) was only reachable indirectly, by loading a full page and
  clicking through the UI to exercise it. Added `tests/unit/` — plain Node (`node:test`, nothing to
  install) tests that `require()` those functions directly, via a small guarded
  `module.exports` block at the end of each file (a no-op in the browser, since `module` doesn't
  exist there — see `tests/unit/README.md`) and a deliberately permissive fake DOM
  (`tests/unit/fake_dom.js`) so a file that also does real DOM wiring at its top level doesn't crash
  on load. 29 tests covering banding/consolidation (including the calmer-tie-break rule), override
  precedence, and CSV round-tripping (quoted fields, Dimension-Key-before-label matching, column
  reordering, template-mismatch flagging) run in ~0.1s total — instant compared to driving the same
  logic through a browser. Playwright stays exactly where it already was for what actually needs a
  browser (UI interaction, real WebSocket/`crypto.subtle`) — this doesn't replace any of that
  coverage, it adds a faster, more precise layer under it. `.github/workflows/tests.yml` now runs
  both tiers. Full suite timed end to end: 29 unit tests (~0.2s) + 21 Playwright files (~1m52s) ≈
  1m53s total, all green.
- 2026-09-12 — Worked through `docs/refactoring-report.md`'s prioritized list, verifying with the
  full test suite after each step rather than as one big change:
  1. Centralized `colorWord()`/`trendWord()` and named `isStatementDimension()` in `helpers.js`,
     replacing duplicated ternary chains and inline `dim.statements && dim.statements.length`
     checks across `render.js`, `squads.js`, `retro.js` (before the split below), and
     `dimensions-templates.js`.
  2. Added `diag()` calls to five previously-silent `.catch(function(){})` sites (`renameSquad`,
     `removeSquad`, `removeDimension`, `deleteTemplate`, `moveDimension`'s two writes) — a rename or
     delete that failed to persist previously left zero trace to debug from.
  3. Collapsed `persistDimensionRating`/`persistDimensionRatings` (90% duplicate code) into one
     function, the single-key case now just calling the batch case with a one-item array.
  4. Added `liveOr(liveFn, localFn)` and `syncLiveIfConnected(writeFn, describe)` to `helpers.js` —
     the two shapes every "write live, else write local" branch in the app already followed,
     duplicated 12+ times across `squads.js`, `dimensions-templates.js`, `retro.js`, and `csv.js`.
     Applied both everywhere that fit the shape cleanly; deliberately left `loadTemplate()`'s and
     `applyImportPlan()`'s live branches alone, since their complexity comes from a genuinely
     different multi-step async chain, not mechanical duplication — forcing them into the same
     helper would have cost clarity, not saved it.
  5. Split `retro.js` (808 lines) into `retro-facilitator.js` and `retro-join.js` along the device
     -role seam the report identified: the two halves shared almost no code, so this was closer to
     "move code" than "redesign code" — see "The app's file layout" above.
  Added tests alongside each step rather than after: `colorWord`/`trendWord`/`isStatementDimension`/
  `liveOr`/`syncLiveIfConnected` all got new `tests/unit/test_helpers.js` cases (34 unit tests now,
  up from 29). The full 21-file Playwright suite was re-run after every one of the 5 steps above,
  not just at the end, so a regression would have been caught at the step that introduced it rather
  than discovered later; all 5 runs were clean. Deliberately not touched this round (still on the
  report's backlog, lower priority): `state.editing`'s hidden dual shape, splitting
  `dimensions-templates.js`, naming/abbreviation consistency, and the `esc()` safety audit.
- 2026-09-12 — Finished the refactoring report's remaining items (except naming consistency, kept
  deferred — see the report's updated "Status" note for why): split `state.editing` into
  `state.editingCell`/`state.editingOverride` (two plainly-named slots instead of one object with a
  hidden `mode:"session"` flag — see `modals.js`'s new `activeEditor()`); split
  `dimensions-templates.js` into `dimensions.js` (the dimension manager) and `templates.js` (template
  save/load/delete), the same device-role-style seam as the earlier `retro.js` split; and ran the
  `esc()` safety audit the report flagged as unaudited. That audit found one real inconsistency:
  `unitLower()`/`unitPluralLower()` output went into `innerHTML` unescaped in 7 places (`render.js`
  ×2, `squads.js` ×3, `csv.js` ×2), while `templates.js`'s own `templateRowHtml` already wrapped the
  same underlying value (`t.unitPlural||t.unit`) in `esc()` — fixed all 7 for consistency. Honest
  caveat, not glossed over: nothing in the current UI actually lets a user set `state.config.unit`/
  `unitPlural` to anything attacker-controlled (no exposed input writes to it directly; every path —
  `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, the three starter templates, `saveCurrentAsTemplate` — only ever copies a value
  already known to be a plain English word), so this closes a latent inconsistency rather than a
  live exploit — worth having fixed regardless, since the next thing that touches this code shouldn't
  have to rediscover the gap. Full 21-file Playwright suite plus the 34-test unit suite re-verified
  passing with zero regressions after each of the three changes.
